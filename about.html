        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Since 2015, HiTEA Cafe has been synonymous with outstanding boba creations and authentic Asian fare. As we continue to expand our operation, it's been a routine pleasure serving the greater Honolulu area. Our specialization in fresh smoothies/teas and scratch-made meals always keep our customers coming back for more. With unique toppings like passion fruit, soft grass jelly, and azuki beans, you can truly customize your dream drink. We're certain from the moment you enjoy a bite of our Minute Chicken, you'll recognize our real passion for all things fresh.
